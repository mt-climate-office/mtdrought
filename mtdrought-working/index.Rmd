As communities across Montana continue to deal with COVID-19, I write to provide an update on the additional steps we are taking at the Montana Climate Office to prevent further spread of the virus and to protect the health and safety of our community. The Montana Climate Office has temporarily closed its doors on the University of Montana Campus and our employees are working from home to help minimize the spread here in MT. Our operations will continue on a modified work schedule. Importantly, our climate data services and drought outlooks will continue on schedule. You can still contact us through email for climate and drought related questions. We are humbled by the hard work of the agricultural community, its creativity in finding solutions and true grit during this challenging time. Said simply, thank you for your efforts to produce our food and sustain Montana’s economy. We are here to help in any way that we can.

Here's what you'll find in the April 2020 Montana Drought & Climate newsletter:

[**Winter 2019/2020 Update**](./review.html) --- Understanding current and past conditions aids in predicting future conditions. This section provides an overview of how this spring is progressing.

[**Spring Forecast**](./forecast.html) --- The seasonal forecast discusses predictions for temperature, precipitation, and drought, as well as the global air circulation patterns that impact growing conditions and water availability in Montana.

[**Reference**](./reference.html) --- A helpful glossary of terms found in this newsletter.

### In Brief {-}

<div style="-webkit-columns: 2 300px;-moz-columns: 2 300px;columns: 2 300px;">
* Despite an early start, winter across Montana has been warmer and drier than average. 

* However, thanks to some sizeable storms in early February snowpack in the mountains is above average.

* The NOAA seasonal forecast for March through May is for cooler and wetter than normal conditions across eastern Montana.

### Data-driven drought monitoring from all Montanans {-}

During this time of "social distancing," the [Montana Climate Office](https://climate.umt.edu/) is working hard to provide Montanans with useful and timely online tools for agricultural decision making. With support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS), we have developed the [Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB) drought indicators dashboard](https://climate.umt.edu/drought). This website provides access to drought indices that are used regularly by the Montana [Governor’s Drought and Water Supply Advisory Committee](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/water/drought-management/drought-committee/monitoring-sub-committee-msc) to advise drought declarations in Montana. The goal is to provide up-to-date drought information using the most current peer reviewed science. Check out the dashboard at [https://climate.umt.edu/drought].

The dashboard is currently under development, and we definitely want your feedback. Please email Zach Hoylman at [state.climatologist@umontana.edu](mailto:state.climatologist@umontana.edu) with any feedback or questions.

### About **Montana Drought & Climate**<br>and the **Montana Climate Office** {-}
[Montana Drought & Climate](https://climate.umt.edu/mtdrought/) is a USDA-funded project of the [Montana Climate Office (MCO)](https://climate.umt.edu/) at the W.A. Franke College of Forestry & Conservation at the University of Montana, in collaboration with the Montana State University Extension Service. The MCO is an independent state-designated body that provides Montanans with high-quality, timely, relevant, and scientifically-based climate information and services. We strive to be a credible and expert source of information for decision makers that rely on the most current information on climate to make important decisions. It is also the role of the MCO to assist stakeholders in interpreting climate information or adapting climate products to their needs.
