Welcome to the October 2020 Montana Drought & Climate newsletter. We hope that Montana farmers and ranchers find the information here useful.

Here's what you'll find in this newsletter:

[**Summer 2020 Review**](./review.html) --- Understanding current and past conditions aids in predicting future conditions. This section provides an overview of how this spring is progressing.

[**Winter Forecast**](./forecast.html) --- The seasonal forecast discusses predictions for temperature, precipitation, and drought, as well as the global air circulation patterns that impact growing conditions and water availability in Montana.

[**Mid-century Outlook**](./midcentury.html) --- What do Montanans need to do to prepare for the future? In this section we present projections of mid-century conditions across Montana. Comparing these projected conditions to current or past conditions gives an improved understanding of how to respond to a changing climate.

[**Reference**](./reference.html) --- A helpful glossary of terms found in this newsletter.

### In Brief {-}

<div style="-webkit-columns: 2 300px;-moz-columns: 2 300px;columns: 2 300px;">
* While June and July were near normal across Montana, August was hot and dry, leading to rapid onset of drought conditions across the state.
* Soil moisture going into winter is low.
* The NOAA seasonal forecast for December through February is for cooler and wetter than normal conditions due to a moderate La Niña climate event.
