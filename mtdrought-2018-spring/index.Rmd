## {-}

Welcome to the April 2018 Montana Drought & Climate newsletter. We are working to provide and interpret climate data for agricultural producers in Montana. With our seasonal newsletters, we hope to transform existing forecasts and projections into useful climate information that meet producer needs. Please [send us your feedback](mailto:mtdrought@umontana.org)!

What information is provided in our Newsletters and what relevance is it?

[**Conditions**](./jfm-2018-review.html) --- Understanding current conditions aids in predicting future conditions. This section provides an overview of what happened over the season and allows producers to reflect on years past in comparison.

[**Forecast**](./amj-2018-forecast.html) --- The seasonal forecast is generally the most frequently requested dataset by producers. Here Temperature, Precipitation, Drought and influential global air circulation patterns are discussed in regional detail.

[**2040--2069 Outlook**](./amj-2018-midcentury.html) --- Modeling allows for a better idea of what mid-century conditions could look like in Montana. Comparing these projected conditions to current or past conditions gives an improved understanding of how to respond to a changing climate.

[**Expert Comments (Agricultural Response)**](amj-2018-summary.html) --- An expert in the agriculture field has provided input on what producers are looking to know. This is where connections and implications between agriculture and climate are discussed.

## April--June 2018 Summary{-}

<div style="-webkit-columns: 2 300px;-moz-columns: 2 300px;columns: 2 300px;">
- Summer 2017 was the second driest and fifth warmest in Montana since record-keeping began in 1895.
- In the summer 2017, the lack of rainfall and brisk winds in eastern Montana led to a rapid onset severe drought, or a “flash drought”, across the state.
- By the middle of the century (e.g. 2050), summer conditions are expected to be significantly warmer but with more precipitation compared to the summer months of 2017
- During fall of 2017, Montana entered a La Niña event. La Niña events often bring cooler temperatures across the state as well as increased winter precipitation specifically to western Montana.
- For winter 2018, above average precipitation and below normal temperatures are forecasted across Montana, in line with a typical La Niña event. However, given the soil moisture deficit hanging on from last summer, it is too early to tell if this forecast will improve the spring growing season. Keep an eye on subsurface soil moisture levels, especially in eastern Montana.

### About **Montana Drought & Climate**<br>and the **Montana Climate Office** {-}
[Montana Drought and Climate](https://climate.umt.edu/mtdrought/) is a USDA-funded project of the [Montana Climate Office (MCO)](https://climate.umt.edu/) at the W.A. Franke College of Forestry & Conservation at the University of Montana, in collaboration with the Montana State University Extension Service. The MCO is an independent state-designated body that provides Montanans with high-quality, timely, relevant, and scientifically-based climate information and services. We strive to be a credible and expert source of information for decision makers that rely on the most current information on climate to make important decisions. It is also the role of the MCO to assist stakeholders in interpreting climate information or adapting climate products to their needs.

Production of this newsletter is supported by Water for Agriculture Challenge Area grant no. 2017-67027-26313 from the [USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture](https://nifa.usda.gov/).
