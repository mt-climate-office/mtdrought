### <img src="./icons/temperature.svg" width="35px"/> Temperature {-}
Aside from a period in early August, temperatures this summer were below normal across much of central Montana, and above normal in northeastern and western Montana. Warm conditions in western Montana contributed to drought declarations in the northwestern part of the state, and led to fears of an above-average fire season which mercifully didn't materialize.

The graph below compares historical daily temperatures (shaded bands and dashed lines) to current daily temperatures in January thru August 2018 (solid-jagged lines) across Montana. The shaded bands represent the range of recorded temperatures during the 1981--2010 period on any given day. The red bands and lines represent the high temperatures and the blues bands and lines represent the lows. The dashed red and blue lines represent the average high and average low temperatures during the 1981--2010 period.

### <img src="./icons/precipitation.svg" width="35px"/> Precipitation {-}
In general, precipitation was above normal across south-central and eastern Montana this summer, and below normal across northern and western Montana. Portions of southern Montana experienced over double the normal amount of summer precipitation! Much of this happened in June, however; July and early August were closer to average across the state.

### ![swe icon](./icons/swe.svg){width="35px"} Snowpack {-}

Snowpack was well above normal going into April across Montana. Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) in the Upper Missouri River Basin above Fort Peck Reservoir and between Fort Peck and Garrison Reservoirs was 127% and 130%, respectively. Snowfall in central and eastern Montana increased the snowpack and covered the ground, which was bare at the end of January. The above normal snowpack will contribute to soil moisture recharge and good growing conditions this summer. However, it will be important to pay close attention to spring temperatures that impact the pace of snowmelt and potential for flooding.

```{r past-seasonal-swe, collapse=TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
past_seasonal_swe <- mtd_plot_swe_basins(date = "2019-03-01", huc = 8)

### ![drought icon](./icons/drought.svg){width="35px"} Drought {-}
By the end of the summer, the US Drought Monitor had declared most of the northern and western portions of Montana to be abnormally dry, with north-central and northwestern portions of the state under drought conditions. This aligns with precipitation patterns from the summer, but see the sections on soil moisture and evapotranspiration, which tell a slightly different story. In northwestern Montana, a deficit of soil moisture and groundwater will need to be resupplied by winter snowpack and spring rainfall in order for drought declarations to be lifted before next year’s growing season.

```{r past-seasonal-drought, cache=TRUE}

past_seasonal_drought <- mtd_plot_usdm(date = "2019-03-01",
                                       data_out = "../data/USDM")
