## In a Word... {-}
Weather and climate forecasters use words and information in very particular ways that may be different from what we are accustomed to. Here is a list of terms we use in this newsletter:
  
<hr>

<div style="-webkit-columns: 3 250px;-moz-columns: 3 250px;columns: 3 250px;">
  ![](./icons/normals.svg){style="height:50px; margin:10px 10px; float:left;"}<br>**Normal(s)** --- Climatologists use "normal" to indicate values---weather measurements like temperature or amount of precipitation---that are expected to occur within a given area, based on past observations. Here, the "normal" value is the statistical mean value (average) for a given measurement over the past observations. Climatologists use the most recent 30-year period, rounded to the nearest decade, to define normal in North America: 1981--2010. The goal is to look far enough back in time to capture variation in weather patterns, but not so far as to be irrelevant to recent conditions. In 2021, we will start using the 1991--2020 period.
<!-- The median is the middle value among observed values when arranged from smallest to largest. 50 percent of the values are above the median, and 50 percent are below it. -->

<div style="float:left;">
![](./icons/temperature.svg){style="height:50px; margin:10px 10px; float:left;"}
<div class="clearfix"></div>
![](./icons/precipitation.svg){style="height:50px; margin:10px 10px; float:left;"}
</div>
<br>**Temperature and Precipitation** --- Throughout this newsletter, we report past temperature and precipitation data derived directly from the [NOAA US Climate Division dataset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/maps/us-climate-divisions.php). Temperature data are reported as seasonal averages; precipitation data are reported as seasonal total precipitation.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

![](./icons/drought.svg){style="height:50px; margin:10px 10px; float:left;"}<br>**Drought** --- The US Drought Monitor identifies general areas of drought and labels them by intensity. Maps of drought intensity are used by policy-makers, resource managers, and agricultural producers to make decisions. More information about the US Drought Monitor can be found at [the US Drought Monitor website](http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/).

<div class="clearfix"></div>

![](./icons/soil_saturation.svg){style="height:50px; margin:10px 10px; float:left;"}<br>**Root Zone Soil Moisture** --- The average volumetric percent soil moisture between 0 and 100 cm depth, or the volume of water divided by the total volume of soil including solids, water, and air. In the maps in this newsletter, soil saturation from [NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite program](https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov) "SPL4SMGP" data product. Soil moisture is mapped via a combination of radar and radiometer measurements from space and surface observations at an approximately 9 km spatial resolution.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

![](./icons/swe.svg){style="height:50px; margin:10px 10px; float:left;"}<br>**Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)** --- SWE is the amount of water contained within the snowpack. It can be thought of as the depth of water that would theoretically result if you melted the entire snowpack. SWE is measured across the West by the [SNOTEL network](https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/about/mon_automate.html) of snow monitoring stations. The SWE percent of normal represents the current snow water equivalent found at selected SNOTEL sites in the basin compared to the normal value for those sites from 1981--2010.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

![](./icons/enso.svg){style="height:50px; margin:10px 10px; float:left;"}<br>**La Niña/El Niño** --- El Niño and La Niña are the warm and cool phases of a recurring climate pattern across the tropical Pacific. The *El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)* is one of several global climate phenomena that affect Montana's weather patterns.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

![](./icons/soil_conditions.svg){style="height:50px; margin:10px 10px; float:left;"}<br>**Soil Conditions** ---

<div class="clearfix"></div>

- *Very poor*: Extreme degree of loss to yield potential. Pastures provide little or no feed.

- *Very short*: Within the top 6" of soil, moisture supply is considerably less than what is required for normal plant development.

Please go to [the USDA National Crop Progress website](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/National_Crop_Progress/Terms_and_Definitions/index.php) for more soil condition and crop definitions.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

![](./icons/flash_drought.svg){style="height:50px; margin:10px 10px; float:left;"}<br>**Flash drought** --- Short periods of no rainfall and/or warm temperatures that induce low and rapidly decreasing soil moisture.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

![](./icons/midcentury.svg){style="height:50px; margin:10px 10px; float:left;"}<br>**Mid-century** --- AD 2040--2069.

<!-- ## Where are you? {-} -->

<!-- Throughout this newsletter, we report weather and forecasts for the seven climate divisions of Montana. The National Oceanic -->
<!-- and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines climate divisions in Montana to roughly conform to major watersheds, adjusted to match county and agricultural region boundaries. Climate information in this newsletter is often summarized across these climate divisions. -->

<!-- ## Weather or Climate? {-} -->

<!-- The difference between weather and climate is the measure of *time*. To understand climate at a given place requires looking at weather over relatively long periods of time. Weather is the day-to-day interaction of factors like temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, visibility, and wind. In addition to studying weather, scientists examine climate trends or cycles of variability to understand the bigger picture of long-term changes. -->
