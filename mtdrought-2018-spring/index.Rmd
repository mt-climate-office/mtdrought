- Summer 2017 was the second driest and fifth warmest in Montana since record-keeping began in 1895.
- In the summer 2017, the lack of rainfall and brisk winds in eastern Montana led to a rapid onset severe drought, or a “flash drought”, across the state.
- By the middle of the century (e.g. 2050), summer conditions are expected to be significantly warmer but with more precipitation compared to the summer months of 2017
- During fall of 2017, Montana entered a La Niña event. La Niña events often bring cooler temperatures across the state as well as increased winter precipitation specifically to western Montana.
- For winter 2018, above average precipitation and below normal temperatures are forecasted across Montana, in line with a typical La Niña event. However, given the soil moisture deficit hanging on from last summer, it is too early to tell if this forecast will improve the spring growing season. Keep an eye on subsurface soil moisture levels, especially in eastern Montana.

### About **Montana Drought & Climate**<br>and the **Montana Climate Office** {-}
[Montana Drought and Climate](https://climate.umt.edu/mtdrought/) is a USDA-funded project of the [Montana Climate Office (MCO)](https://climate.umt.edu/) at the W.A. Franke College of Forestry & Conservation at the University of Montana, in collaboration with the Montana State University Extension Service. The MCO is an independent state-designated body that provides Montanans with high-quality, timely, relevant, and scientifically-based climate information and services. We strive to be a credible and expert source of information for decision makers that rely on the most current information on climate to make important decisions. It is also the role of the MCO to assist stakeholders in interpreting climate information or adapting climate products to their needs.
