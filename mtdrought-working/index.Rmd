* El Nino didn't happen, despite warm pacific SSTs
* ENSO neutral conditions are producing weather very close to average this winter
* There remains a 65% chance of an El Nino developing this spring
* The NOAA seasonal forecast, which takes El Ni√±o and other current climate patterns into account, is for warmer conditions statewide this spring, with equal chances of above or below normal precipitation.
