### In Brief:{-}

<div style="-webkit-columns: 2 300px;-moz-columns: 2 300px;columns: 2 300px;">
* Across Montana, cool weather this spring will likely give way to warmer than normal summer temperatures.

* Much of the state has experienced drier than normal conditions since April, which are likely to continue into the summer.

* Moderate drought conditions have been declared in southwestern Montana, and many parts of the state are abnormally dry as of early June. Expectdry conditions to persist and intensify if dry and warm seasonal forecasts play out as expected.

### Get Up-to-date Drought Conditions in Montana {-}

As we move into the summer, the [Montana Climate Office](https://climate.umt.edu/) continues to monitor developing drought conditions across Montana, and to provide *you* with useful and timely online tools for agricultural decision making. Be sure to keep an eye on the [Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB) drought indicators dashboard](https://drought.climate.umt.edu)---it is updated nightly, and provides access to drought metrics used regularly by the [Montana Governorâ€™s Drought and Water Supply Advisory Committee](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/water/drought-management/drought-committee/monitoring-sub-committee-msc). Check out the dashboard at https://drought.climate.umt.edu.

The dashboard is currently under development, and we continue to gather feedback from producers across the state. Please email Zach Hoylman at [state.climatologist@umontana.edu](mailto:state.climatologist@umontana.edu) with any feedback or questions.
