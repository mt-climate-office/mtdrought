Each fall, we provide current projections about how conditions in Montana are projected to change by mid-century. Agriculture is an incredibly important part of Montana’s culture, economy, and landscape, and an industry that is directly impacted by changes in temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events.  We realize that agricultural operations in Montana are diverse and that each producer will need to respond differently to changing conditions. Below we describe projects for mid-century in a number of ways and list resources that might be helpful to producers.  (this paragraph needs some help!)

**Feast or famine? Bigger and more unpredictable swings year-to-year**

While climate is changing in a particular direction (warmer temperatures), we are already seeing larger fluctuations in precipitation, with some very wet years and some intense drought years, as compared with the past. These year-to-year variations are projected to become more extreme and harder to predict. This is important because research has shown that this lack of predictability can be particularly challenging for farmers and ranchers. To respond, agricultural producers need to think about how to plan for drought while also retaining the flexibility to take advantage of wet years.

**What will my climate be like in 2050?**

To better understand where your climate is heading, we’ve provided spatial analogs for three locations in Montana. Spatial analogs have become popular with agricultural producers because they provide a tangible and plausible representation of future climate in a particular place, based on what scientists currently know about how the climate is changing. For example, in 2050, it’s plausible that the climate of Fort Benton will similar to the current climate of the Utah Valley (Salt Lake City area). This information provides farmers and ranchers with an understanding of what kind of agriculture can thrive under future conditions.
