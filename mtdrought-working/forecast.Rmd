### <img src="icons/enso.svg" width="35px"/> El Niño Update {-}

The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a natural seasonal fluctuation in the sea surface temperature of the Pacific ocean near the equator. El Niño events have a stong influence on winter weather across Montana, and less of an influence during the rest of the year.

Back in October, NOAA was predicting an El Niño event would begin over the winter. A weak El Niño finally formed during January 2019, and weak El Niño conditions are likely to continue into spring. Historically, El Niño events bring slightly warmer than normal spring temperatures to northern and western Montana, and slightly cooler than normal temperatures in southeastern Montana. Spring precipitation during an El Niño event is very close to normal across the state.

These maps show what an average El Niño March--May looks like relative to normal. Keep an eye on the NOAA ENSO outlook ([https://www.climate.gov/enso](https://www.climate.gov/enso)) for the latest ENSO conditions and predictions as we head into spring.

```{r load enso, cache=TRUE}
# enso <- mtd_get_all_enso_ee(start_date = "2019-03-01",
#                                 end_date = "2019-06-01") %T>%
#   readr::write_rds("../Data/gridmet/ENSO_MAM.rds",
#                      compress = "gz")

enso <- readr::read_rds("../Data/gridmet/ENSO_MAM.rds")

enso %<>%
  purrr::transpose()
  
enso$pr %<>%
  purrr::map(mm_to_in)

enso$tmmn %<>%

enso %<>%
  purrr::transpose() %>%

    x$tmean <- (x$tmmn + x$tmmx)/2
    return(x)
  })

enso_series <- mtd_get_enso_series_ee()

```

Early spring during an El Niño event is on average warmer than normal across Montana, especially as you move towards northwestern Montana.

```{r future-seasonal-enso, fig.retina = 2, fig.align = "center", out.width = '100%', collapse=TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

enso$`El Niño` %>%
  mtd_plot_enso_grid(element = "tmean",
                   use_normal = TRUE,
                   Season = "Mar-May") %T>%
  save_mt_map("forecast_enso_tmean.pdf")

enso$`El Niño` %>%
  mtd_plot_enso_grid(element = "prcp",
                   use_normal = TRUE,
                   Season = "Mar-May") %T>%
  save_mt_map("forecast_enso_prcp.pdf")

```

The two graphs below show how Montana as a whole is affected by the ENSO climate patterns. The solid lines represent the average conditions in each of El Niño, La Niña, and ENSO Neutral conditions (see the [Reference](./reference.html) section for an explanation of these conditions). The dashed lines represent the range of recorded conditions during the 1981--2010 period on any given day.

For temperature, ENSO conditions only have a strong influence on Montana climate in the winter months; the solid green line (El Niño) is above the other lines, indicating warmer conditions on average in El Niño years.

For precipitation, however, it is very difficult to distinguish the three solid lines. El Niño conditions lead to slightly drier winters, while La Niña conditions are indistinguishable from ENSO Neutral conditions with regard to winter precipitation across Montana.

```{r future-seasonal-enso-prcp, collapse=TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}

enso_series %>%
  mtd_plot_climatology_enso(element = "tmean",
                            ybreaks = seq(-10, 80, 10))
  ggplot2::ggsave("./figures/forecast_enso_graph_tmean.pdf")

enso_series %>%
  mtd_plot_climatology_enso(element = "prcp",
                            ybreaks = seq(0,0.8,0.1))

### <img src="icons/temperature.svg" width="35px"/> Temperature {-}
ENSO has a strong influence on weather in North America, so NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC) seasonal projections for this spring are in part guided by ENSO conditions. The CPC is projecting that temperatures will likely be warmer across Montana this spring, especially going into April. Warmer temperatures may accelerate spring snowmelt and prompt an earlier start to the growing season.

```{r future-seasonal-temp, collapse=TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

noaa_seasonal <- mtd_plot_noaa_seasonal_forecast(date = "2019-03-01",
                                                 element = "temp",
                                                 data_out = "../data/NOAA_seasonal")

noaa_seasonal$map %T>%
  save_mt_map("forecast_noaa_seasonal_temperature.pdf")
```

### <img src="icons/precipitation.svg" width="35px"/> Precipitation {-}

Wait, what's going on with this precipitation map? It doesn't look like there is anything on it! That's right---the CPC isn't making predictions one way or another for preciptation this spring. The entire state of Montana is in the "Equal Chances" category, meaning that our precipitation is likely to be near-normal, but might be higher or lower than normal depending on particular storm tracks. 

```{r future-seasonal-prcp, collapse=TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

noaa_seasonal <- mtd_plot_noaa_seasonal_forecast(date = "2019-03-01",
                                                 element = "prcp",
                                                 data_out = "../data/NOAA_seasonal")

noaa_seasonal$map %T>%
  save_mt_map("forecast_noaa_seasonal_precipitation.pdf")

```

<!-- ### <img src="icons/drought.svg" width="35px"/> Drought {-} -->
<!-- The three month drought outlook suggests that drought will persist through August in Daniels, Sheridan, and Roosevelt counties. Due to late may rainfall these counties were recently downgraded to “abnormally dry.” Drought development is not predicted for the remainder of the state; however, drought development may still be possible given the uncertain seasonal forecast (above) for eastern portions of the state and warmer and drier than normal forecast for western portions of the state. For example, portions of Valley, Phillips, and Blaine counties have been designated as abnormally dry due to lack of rainfall in the past month and drying soil conditions. -->
