Welcome to the October 2019 Montana Drought & Climate newsletter. We hope that Montana farmers and ranchers find the information here useful. Please [send us your feedback](mailto:mtdrought@umontana.edu)!

Here's what you'll find in this newsletter:

[**Summer 2019 Review**](./review.html) --- Understanding current and past conditions aids in predicting future conditions. This section provides an overview of how this spring is progressing.

[**Fall/Winter 2019 Forecast**](./forecast.html) --- The seasonal forecast discusses predictions for temperature, precipitation, and drought, as well as the global air circulation patterns that impact growing conditions and water availability in Montana.

[**Mid-century Outlook**](./midcentury.html) --- What do Montanans need to do to prepare for the future? In this section we present projections of mid-century conditions across Montana. Comparing these projected conditions to current or past conditions gives an improved understanding of how to respond to a changing climate.

[**Reference**](./reference.html) --- A helpful glossary of terms found in this newsletter.

### In Brief {-}

<div style="-webkit-columns: 2 300px;-moz-columns: 2 300px;columns: 2 300px;">
* April and May saw the return of generally normal temperatures across Montana. A series of cold storms have given way to warm spring weather across most of the state. This has accelerated snowmelt in the high country and has led to flood conditions in western and central Montana.
* Soil moisture is high across Montana, though drying is occurring in the southwestern and eastern parts of the state.
* Abnormally dry conditions (the level just below drought conditions) exist in northwestern Montana. Evapotranspiration is also lower than normal in northwestern Montana, suggesting plant communities there are already experiencing the effects of dry conditions.
* The NOAA seasonal forecast for Juneâ€“August is for warmer than normal conditions in western Montana and equal chances of warmer or cooler conditions for the rest of the state. Summer is likely going to be wetter than normal across most of Montana.

### About **Montana Drought & Climate**<br>and the **Montana Climate Office** {-}
[Montana Drought & Climate](https://climate.umt.edu/mtdrought/) is a USDA-funded project of the [Montana Climate Office (MCO)](https://climate.umt.edu/) at the W.A. Franke College of Forestry & Conservation at the University of Montana, in collaboration with the Montana State University Extension Service. The MCO is an independent state-designated body that provides Montanans with high-quality, timely, relevant, and scientifically-based climate information and services. We strive to be a credible and expert source of information for decision makers that rely on the most current information on climate to make important decisions. It is also the role of the MCO to assist stakeholders in interpreting climate information or adapting climate products to their needs.
