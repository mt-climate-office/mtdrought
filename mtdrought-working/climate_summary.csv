Climate Metric—,Trend and future scenario
Atmospheric CO2 concentrations,Global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased over 100 ppm since Montana statehood and are projected to increase under both future scenarios considered here.
Average temperature,"Since 1950, average statewide temperatures have increased by 0.5°F/decade (0.3°C/decade), with greatest warming in spring; projected to increase by 3-7°F (1.7-3.9°C) by mid century, with greatest warming in summer and winter and in the southeast."
Maximum temperatures,"Maximum temperatures have increased most in spring and are projected to increase 3-8°F (1.7-4.4°C) by mid century, with greatest increases in August and in the southeast."
Days above 90°F (32°C),"Extreme heat days are projected to increase by 5-35 additional days by mid century, with greatest increases in the northeast and south."
Minimum temperatures,"Minimum temperatures have increased most in winter and spring and are projected to increase 3-7°F (1.7-3.9°C) by mid century, with greatest increases in January and in the southeast."
Frost-free days,"Frost-free days are projected to increase by 24-44 days by mid century, particularly in the west."
Average precipitation,"Statewide precipitation has decreased in winter ( 0.14 inches/decade [-0.36 cm/decade]) since 1950, but no significant change has occurred in annual mean precipitation, probably because of very slight increases in spring and fall precipitation. Precipitation is projected to increase, primarily in spring (0.2-0.7 inches [0.5-1.8 cm]) in the northwest; a slight statewide decrease in summer precipitation and increased year-to-year variability of precipitation are projected, as well."
Number of consecutive dry days,"Little projected change, with a maximum increase of 3 days to -3 days under the most severe scenario by end of the century. However, increased variability in precipitation suggests potential for more severe droughts, particularly in connection with climate oscillations."
Number of consecutive wet days,No substantial change projected.
